# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. 


Features: 
1) Data Preprocessing: Handling imbalanced datasets, normalization, and feature selection to prepare data for modeling.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing transaction data to understand patterns and anomalies.

3) Model Training: Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and more.

4) Evaluation Metrics: Using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.

5) Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to improve detection accuracy.
